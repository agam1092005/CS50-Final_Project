####Description
This project is a sophisticated web browser application created using a combination of Python's PyQt5 module, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The integration of a Weather API adds an extra layer of functionality, making it a versatile tool.

Key Features:

Python PyQt5 Module: The graphical user interface is built using PyQt5, a set of Python bindings for Qt libraries. This ensures a smooth and responsive user experience.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: The combination of these web technologies allows for the creation of dynamic and visually appealing web pages within the application. HTML structures the content, CSS styles it, and JavaScript adds interactivity.

Web Browser Functionality: The core functionality revolves around providing a web browsing experience. Users can navigate through different websites seamlessly, making it a comprehensive browser.

Weather API Integration: The integration of a Weather API enhances the application's utility. Users can check real-time weather updates directly from the browser, making it a one-stop solution for information gathering.

Efficient Browsing: Users can enjoy a user-friendly browsing experience with features like tab management, bookmarks, and history tracking.

Weather Updates: The built-in Weather API integration ensures that users can quickly access current weather conditions and forecasts without switching between different applications.

The various Website elements, i.e, images are taken from internet.
The searches in the application can be done using 3 engines, i.e,
1. Google
2. Bing
3. DuckDuckGo

The Weather API is taken from openweathermap.org

The Biggest Challenge in the entire project was to ask permission from PyQt5 Application of latitute and longitute for accessing weather data.
